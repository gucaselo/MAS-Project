all data to a database to visualize our findings.

### General info
We webscraped our data and found 1972 incidents/events, 2071 deaths, and 8426 injured.  Our interactive map shows all of the 
incidents and information about each state. The states on the map are shown by their poverty rate and other available layers.
Our entire website is interactive and includes visualizations.

### Project Overview
We transformed and cleaned our MSA, gun ownership, election, and state coordinate data before loading it into a SQLite database.  
We then used Flask to connect and create visualizations and our interactive map.
